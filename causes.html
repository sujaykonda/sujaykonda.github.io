        <h1>How sports betting slipped into campus life</h1>
        <p class="lede">
          Advertising, design tricks, and social pressure make betting feel like a normal part of being a fan. Here’s how companies pulled it off—and why it matters.

          <div class="card">
            <h3>“Risk-free” inducements</h3>
            <p>
              Free bets, bonus credits, and money-back guarantees frame gambling as harmless. After one or two wins, students assume it was skill and switch to real cash.
            </p>
            <p>
              Research shows sign-up bonuses are the strongest trigger for risky betting, especially when promos mimic sports commentary and blend into social feeds.

            <h3>Fantasy-to-betting pipeline</h3>
            <p>
              Fantasy leagues market to teens and young adults as “strategy.” That confidence transfers to betting, where odds are against them, creating a pipeline from harmless play to high-risk wagers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nearly half of fantasy players are 18–34, so the transition to betting feels like a natural upgrade.

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Apps that resist quitting</h3>
            <p>
              “Responsible gambling” tools are weak by design. Meanwhile, flashing graphics, instant deposits, push alerts, and “nearly won” animations copy casino conditioning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Companies profit from frequent losses, so truly protective design would hurt their revenue.

            <h3>Peer pressure and group chats</h3>
            <p>
              Journalist Rachel Hale calls betting “the new binge drinking” for college men—socially reinforced and risky. McGee’s public health research shows friends encourage bets as a shared habit, not a private choice.
            </p>
            <p>
              As posts normalize betting, some students replace offline friendships with online gambling communities, making exit harder.

            <h3>Debt before diplomas</h3>
            <p>
              Normalization can lead to financial precarity: students using credit cards or loans to keep betting, often without grasping long-term impact. The pattern mirrors the online poker boom where “it’s just a hobby” masked serious risk-taking.
