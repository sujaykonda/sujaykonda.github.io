        <p class="lede">
          Sports betting has slipped into college life as casually as a meme in the group chat.
          This page examines how manipulative tactics, social pressure, and weak regulation make young adults uniquely vulnerable—and what we can do about it.

        <h2>Why this matters to me</h2>
        <p>
          When I hear a friend joke, “The Eagles have to win, I bet so much on them,” it lands hard. A relative of mine once started with small wagers—five or ten dollars after work—then hit a streak and convinced himself he was “good” at sports betting. Confidence turned to overconfidence, and overconfidence turned to debt. He opened credit cards that weren’t his, chasing “one big win” that never came. My family intervened before he lost everything, but the experience changed how I hear casual betting talk. Gambling rarely feels dangerous until the losses arrive.
        </p>
        <p>
          On campus, that same pattern is playing out at scale. Since the 2018 repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) made online sports betting legal in most states, gambling has shifted from the margins to the mainstream. DraftKings, FanDuel, and BetMGM logos now fill broadcasts, TikTok feeds, and even the University of Maryland football stadium. Nearly a quarter of Americans placed a sports bet in the past year, and college students are prime targets.

        <div class="grid">
          <div class="card">
            <h3>“Risk-free” inducements</h3>
            <p>
              Free bets, bonus credits, and money-back guarantees frame gambling as harmless. Once students win once or twice, they feel confident switching to real cash, believing it was skill. Rolison et al. show young adults consistently overestimate their predictive ability because of overconfidence and misunderstanding of odds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Di Censo, Delfabbro, and King found sign-up bonuses were the strongest trigger for risky betting, especially when the promos mimic sports commentary and blend into social media feeds.
            </p>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Fantasy-to-betting pipeline</h3>
            <p>
              Fantasy sports let players “manage” teams and win cash in daily contests. Nearly half of fantasy players are 18–34, and many leagues now run for money. The strategic vibe of fantasy transfers to betting, giving students the illusion they can beat the system (Houghton et al.).
            </p>
            <p>
              Because fantasy platforms market to teens, they normalize constant wagering early, making the jump to high-risk betting in college feel natural.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Designed to keep you in-app</h3>
            <p>
              “Responsible gambling” tools—deposit limits, self-exclusion, automated warnings—are presented as safeguards, but studies show most students exposed to them do not change behavior (Houghton and Moss). The apps counteract limits with flashing graphics, instant deposits, and “nearly won” animations that mimic casino conditioning.
            </p>
            <p>
              The business model depends on frequent losses, so effective protection would cut revenue. That misalignment is why outside regulation matters.

            <h3>The new “binge drinking”?</h3>
            <p>
              Journalist Rachel Hale calls sports betting “the new binge drinking” for college men—socially reinforced and risky. McGee’s research in the UK echoes this: friends encourage one another, and betting becomes a shared habit rather than an individual choice.
            </p>
            <p>
              As posts and group chats normalize betting, students replace offline friendships with online gambling communities (Sirola et al.), making it harder to step away.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card card--accent">
            <h3>Debt before diplomas</h3>
            <p>
              Normalization feeds financial harm. McGee documents young men using credit cards and payday loans to keep betting. College students—often financially inexperienced—may not grasp the impact of maxed-out cards or missed payments until debt piles up.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pattern mirrors the online poker boom: when gambling feels like a harmless hobby, risk-taking skyrockets.

        <h2>What should change</h2>
        <p>
          Because betting apps profit from the losses of their heaviest users, meaningful change requires outside pressure. Federal regulators can restrict inducement advertising near campuses, close loopholes that let 18-year-olds gamble online, and require plain-language risk disclosures on promos. Universities can integrate gambling literacy into orientation, train resident assistants to spot red flags, and partner with counseling centers to offer low-friction support. Platforms should be required to default to hard deposit caps, delay “instant” deposits, and ban “risk-free” language that misrepresents odds. These steps would not eliminate betting, but they would rebalance power away from companies and toward informed student choice.

        <h2>Why the usual defenses fall short</h2>
        <div class="list">
          <div class="list__item">
            <h3>“We boost the economy.”</h3>
            <p>
              The American Gaming Association touts jobs and $22.4 billion in GDP, but that revenue comes from a majority of bettors losing. The question is whether states should profit from students’ losses. Economic gains do not erase the public health costs.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="list__item">
            <h3>“Regulation already protects users.”</h3>
            <p>
              Oversight is thin, and companies exploit gaps with aggressive promotions. As long as profit depends on heavy losses, self-regulation will be weak. Consumer protection and company incentives remain misaligned.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="list__item">
            <h3>“It’s a matter of personal freedom.”</h3>
            <p>
              Freedom assumes informed choice. Ads that label bets “free money” or “investments” distort the decision. Young adults are especially prone to overconfidence and the illusion of control—biases that targeted advertising amplifies. Limiting manipulative tactics preserves, rather than limits, real choice.

        <h2>Act before the damage feels permanent</h2>
        <p>
          Sports betting embedded itself into college life so quickly that many students barely recognize it as gambling. What was once a casino habit is now framed as entertainment, strategy, even financial literacy. But the evidence is clear: inducements drive risky behavior, social pressure normalizes loss, and “responsible gambling” tools are too weak to matter. Waiting for individual willpower to fix a structural problem only benefits the companies profiting from our losses.
        </p>
        <p>
          If policymakers, educators, and students move now—tightening advertising rules, teaching gambling literacy, and demanding real safeguards—there is still time to prevent gambling from becoming this generation’s next public health crisis. The industry has more to gain from our losses than our well-being. We should answer with boundaries strong enough to protect both our finances and our future.
