        <p class="lede">
          Before I saw betting apps on every screen, I watched a relative fall into debt chasing “one big win.” That experience shapes how I hear casual campus jokes about parlays and “free money.”

        <h2>From small bets to stolen credit cards</h2>
        <p>
          A relative of mine started with five-dollar wagers after work. A few lucky wins convinced him he was “good” at betting. Then those small bets turned to large ones, and his “winnings” turned to losses. Desperate to recover, he opened credit cards that weren’t his. My family intervened before he lost everything, but the experience made something clear: gambling feels safe right up until it doesn’t.

            <h3>“It’s not gambling if you know sports.”</h3>
            <p>
              Friends insist they have an “edge” because they watch every game. Ads reinforce that overconfidence by calling bets “investments.”

            <h3>Peer pressure in group chats</h3>
            <p>
              Odds and parlays circulate like memes. Saying “I’m out” can feel awkward, so people download apps just to stay in the conversation.

            <h3>Fantasy as a gateway</h3>
            <p>
              Daily fantasy contests blur into betting. Because fantasy is framed as strategy, students assume the same skills will beat house odds.
